Some test data for project 1, Robot Dolphin Rodeo

g0 - a cycle: all nodes are both bases and sponges.
g1 - several bases, one sponge.
g2 - one base, several sponges.
g3 - no bases, some sponges (more than one source component)
g4 - some bases, no sponges (more than one sink component)
g5 - no bases or sponges
g6a - no edges, one vertex
g6b - no edges, several vertices
g6c - n = 2, m = 1

g7 - larger example (still works with MAXV = 100)
g8 - another larger example (still works with MAXV = 100)

//g9 - Huge example to come later (will need larger MAXV)
g7raw - ignore it
